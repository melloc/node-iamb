# iamb

## Configuration

Create a configuration file `mm-account.json`:

...................................
{
    "url": "<mattermost url",
    "team": "<your team name>",
    "auth": {
        "username": "<your username>",
        "password": "<your password>"
    }
}
...................................


## Usage

When you initially start iamb, you will yourself in the Lobby. This space
is used by iamb for printing out information unrelated to any of your ongoing
conversations. If you navigate away from here but want to return, you can type
`gl` to open the Lobby in the currently focused window.

Note that when a key should be pressed while holding control, these documents
will write `^<key>`, to indicate holding control plus `<key>`. A literal press
of caret (`^`) will be written on its own.

TIP: From within iamb you can type `:help [name]` to see the help message
for another command.

### Messaging

iamb currently supports joining Mattermost channels and direct messages.
To join a channel, type `:join [channel]`, or, to message a user directly,
type `:dm [user]`.

TIP: Use `^O` and `^I` to navigate backwards and forwards in a window's room
history.

### Editing

When editing a message, iamb supports most vim keybindings for editing.
footnote:[If you find a keybinding you use missing, please
https://github.com/melloc/node-iamb/issues[open an issue] so we can add it!]
Once you are ready to send your message, press
`<Enter>` while in `NORMAL` mode.

You may also find the `:registers` useful. It will display the contents of all
registers in the Lobby

### Windows

If you want to view multiple rooms concurrently, you can create new windows
using the `:split` command, which duplicates the existing window (including
current scroll position).

To move focus between windows, use `^W<direction>` where `<direction>` is one
of `h`, `j`, `k`, or `l`. When you are done with a window, type `:quit` to
close it. If there is only a single remaining window, then this will exit
iamb. (If you have multiple windows open and don't want to close each
individually, type `:qall`.)

### Scrolling

Since most messages are limited to a few lines, iamb repurposes line navigation
shortcuts for moving around a room's history. `gg` will go to the top of a
room's history, and `G` to the bottom. You can scroll incrementally with the
following shortcuts:
